# ********************************* RULES OF NAMING THE VARIABLES *************************************** #

# 1 -> Variables Can't start with Numbers      (1number =4      ---->>>> ERROR!!!!!!!)
# 2 -> Variables can be start with a Letter , underscore(_)    (EXAMPLE :     _name = "TUSHAR"              --------->>>> NO ERROR !!!!!!!)

_name = "AJAY"
print(_name)

# 3 -> Variables can't start with special symbols like $,^,&,*,% and......... ($name = "ajay"   ---------------->>>>> ERROR !!!!!!!!!!)
# 4 -> If we are using more than one word in a line for a variable then seperate it by underscore

user_one_name = "Sunny"                    # This is called SNAKE CASE WRITING
